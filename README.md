RebirthItemTracker
==================

This uses the `log.txt` file to track item pickups in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This is particularly useful for streamers, so their viewers can see their items, but can be used by anyone. It's easier to see what items you have on the tracker than it is on the pause screen. Additionally, it...

- shows stats for picked up items.
- marks items that were picked up during a _Curse of the Blind_.
- shows what floor items were picked up on.
- shows the floor the player is currently on.
- displays the current seed.

Download it [here](https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/RebirthItemTracker/releases) (get the latest file that doesn't have "source code" in the name).

To use it, first extract that zip file and then run the exe inside.

It tries to read `log.txt` from inside `C:\Users\ (you) \Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Rebirth\`.

If it's unable to find that file, you might need to put the tracker folder into that rebirth folder.

You can right click anywhere in the window to get an options screen.

You can mouse over items you've picked up to see their stats again, and click on them to open [platinumgod.co.uk](http://platinumgod.co.uk/) in your browser for more information about that item (arrow keys and enter also work).
